# voice-thenticate: A Simple Voice Authentication App using SpeechBrain
This Streamlit app demonstrates speaker verification using [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain), allowing users to enroll and verify their identity with their voice.

## How to Use
-  Visit the streamlit app: https://voice-thenticate-fmtvslhn5uxhfnctktr9u2.streamlit.app/
-  Sign In or Sign Up with your username
-  Under `Set Up Your Voice ID`, record a short sample of your voice.
- Under `Verify Your Voice ID`, record another voice sample.
   
The app will verify your voice and display the result (success or failure).

Note that this is a basic demonstration and may not be suitable for high-security applications.
